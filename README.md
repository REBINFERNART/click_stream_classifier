Clickstream Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing clickstream data to predict prices and classify customer behaviors. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, machine learning model training, and deployment using Streamlit.

Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed correlations and covariance between features.

Used various visualization techniques (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots) to understand relationships in the data.

Identified important features for price prediction and classification.

Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavior.

Evaluated cluster quality using Silhouette Score and adjusted the number of clusters accordingly.

Machine Learning Models

Regression Model: Trained a model to predict prices based on selected features.

Classification Model: Developed a model to classify customer behaviors based on clickstream data.

Deployment

Built a Streamlit web app for easy interaction.

Allowed users to input data manually or upload CSV files for prediction.

Integrated both regression and classification models for flexible use.
